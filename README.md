# bayes_selector

Code for different packing and matching algorithms
The dimension of the problem (number of resources) must be at least 2. If you want to run a one dimensional problem, you must add a dummy resource. 

run_packing.py runs all the packing algorithms
run_matching.py runs all the matching algorithms
